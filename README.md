# Alberto Figueroba SÃ¡nchez - Data Analysis Portfolio 

## About

My name is Alberto Figueroba. I have a PhD and a Mater's in Computational and Theoretical Chemistry (University of Barcelona). I have worked 8 years in the R/D sector. I am specialized in the modeling of nanostructured systems with various applications, such as catalysis or solar cells. Currently, I am transitioning from the resarch field towards data analysis, where I seek to apply all the knowledge obtained during the last years. I am a experienced researcher and analyst, with expertise at managing and monitoring data from multiple data sources, such as Excel and Google Sheets. I have entry-level in SQL and R programming and Understanding of Python language.
