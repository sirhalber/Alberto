# Alberto Figueroba SÃ¡nchez - Data Analysis Portfolio 

## About

I am Alberto. I have a PhD and a Mater's in Computational and Theoretical Chemistry (University of Barcelona). I have worked 8 years in the R/D sector. I am specialized in the modeling of nanostructured systems with various applications, such as catalysis or solar cells. Currently, I am transitioning from the resarch field towards data analysis.

This is a repository to showcase skills, share projects and track my progress in Data Analytics.
